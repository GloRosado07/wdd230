            <h3 class="discover-title">Rafting</h3>
            <p>The Pacuare River is the best choice for rafting in Costa Rica. No other adventure trek in the country exists that offers you a perfect blend of wilderness exposure and excitement, all in one day.

                Pacuare is world famous for its sheer beauty. A true river gorge, it is flanked by steep, green walls. Here you enjoy the feeling of total isolation from urban life and the realness of being connected with nature.
                You see waterfalls cascade into the river from both sides as colorful, tropical birds fly right over your head. Amazing views of this virgin tropical rainforest area, appear before your eyes as you descend 
                this true exploratory land. Wildlife is abundant, with sloth, toucans, parrots, coatis, morpho butterflies and colorful frogs being common sights.</p>

            <h3 class="discover-title">Rice & Beans </h3>
            <p>Food in Costa Rica is second only to the country‚Äôs beauty. Known for its use of fresh ingredients, like fruits and vegetables, the cuisine in Costa Rica is generally on the mild side.

                <br> Costa Rican food is much different than other Latin American food, especially Mexican food. Of course, Mexico is not the only place to find its spicy food. 
                San Diego which is just north of Mexico is also known for its Mexican and Latin American influence in its cuisine.
                
                <br>Exotic fruits grow locally in the tropical environment, so there is always something to make the food exciting.</p>
